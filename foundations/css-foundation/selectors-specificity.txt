Selector weight categories
The selector weight categories are listed here in the order of decreasing specificity:

ID column
Includes only ID selectors, such as #example. For each ID in a matching selector, add 1-0-0 to the weight value.

CLASS column
Includes class selectors, such as .myClass, attribute selectors like [type="radio"] and [lang|="fr"], and pseudo-classes, such as :hover, :nth-of-type(3n), and :required. For each class, attribute selector, or pseudo-class in a matching selector, add 0-1-0 to the weight value.

TYPE column
Includes type selectors, such as p, h1, and td, and pseudo-elements like ::before, ::placeholder, and all other selectors with double-colon notation. For each type or pseudo-element in a matching selector, add 0-0-1 to the weight value.

No value
The universal selector (*) and the pseudo-class :where() and its parameters aren't counted when calculating the weight, but they do match elements. The value for both the universal selector and the pseudo-class is 0-0-0; these selectors do not impact the specificity weight value.
